## The implementation of the backend:

•	Spring Boot: We leveraged the Spring Boot framework to develop the backend of the system. Spring Boot offers a range of features, including dependency injection, data access, security, and RESTful API development, making it an ideal choice for our project.

•	Java: We utilized Java as the primary programming language for backend development. Java's object-oriented nature and extensive libraries provided a solid foundation for building the backend logic.

•	Spring Security: To ensure the security of the system, we integrated Spring Security to handle user authentication and authorization. It enabled us to enforce access controls and protect sensitive data.

•	Spring Data JPA: We used Spring Data JPA to interact with the database. It simplified the data access layer by providing convenient abstractions and automatic CRUD operations.

•	PostgreSQL: For data storage, we employed the PostgreSQL relational database management system.
